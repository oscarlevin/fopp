        <p>The prompt that we will be using is the following:</p>
        <p><em>Build a program that replicates a physical dictionary that you might use. The program should that take five different input from the user. Each input will have two words and we will build a dictionary where the words are the keys and values</em>.</p>
        <p>Try writting out what you think the outline would be, and then check out our answer to see how we did it! Always remember that there can be multiple ways to solve a problem, so your solution may be different from ours but still solve the problem.</p>

    <program xml:id="answer500_2_1" language="python">
    
        <input>
# initialize a dictionary

# write a for loop that will iterate five times. I can use the range function for this!

# in the for loop, I should ask for input from the user

# next, I should separate the words

# finally, I should add the key value pair to the dictionary
