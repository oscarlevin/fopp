        <p>Readability is very important to programmers, since in practice programs are
            read and modified far more often then they are written.</p>
        
        
        
        <p>We'll have more to say about style as our programs become more complex, but a
            few pointers will be helpful already:</p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>
                <p>use 4 spaces for indentation</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>imports should go at the top of the file</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>separate function definitions with two blank lines</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>keep function definitions together</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>keep top level statements, including function calls, together at the
                    bottom of the program</p>
            </li>
        </ul></p>
