        <p>First, let's learn about a few functions and methods that we'll use along the way to do this project. There are no questions to answer in these next few active code windows, they are just here to introduce or reintroduce you to some functions and methods that you may not be aware of. The active code window that starts with <q>Part A</q> is where you are first asked to complete code.</p>
        <p>The <c>time.sleep(s)</c> function (from the <c>time</c> module) delays execution of the next line of code for <c>s</c> seconds. You'll find that we can build a little suspense during gameplay with some well-placed delays. The game can also be easier for users to understand if not everything happens instantly.</p>

<exercise label="wof_ac_wof_player">
    <statement>
        <p><term>Part A: ``WOFPlayer``</term></p>
        <p>We're going to start by defining a class to represent a Wheel of Fortune player, called <c>WOFPlayer</c>. Every instance of <c>WOFPlayer</c> has three instance variables:</p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>
                <p><c>.name</c>: The name of the player (should be passed into the constructor)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><c>.prizeMoney</c>: The amount of prize money for this player (an integer, initialized to <c>0</c>)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><c>.prizes</c>: The prizes this player has won so far (a list, initialized to <c>[]</c>)</p>
            </li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>It should also have the following methods (note: we will exclude <c>self</c> in our descriptions):</p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>
                <p><c>.addMoney(amt)</c>: Add <c>amt</c> to <c>self.prizeMoney</c></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><c>.goBankrupt()</c>: Set <c>self.prizeMoney</c> to <c>0</c></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><c>.addPrize(prize)</c>: Add <c>prize</c> to <c>self.prizes</c></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <dl>
                    <li>
                        <title><c>.__str__()</c>: Returns the player's name and prize money in the following format:</title>
                        
                            <p><ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p><c>Steve ($1800)</c> (for a player with instance variables <c>.name == 'Steve'</c> and <c>prizeMoney == 1800</c>)</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul></p>
                        
                    </li>
                </dl>
            </li>
        </ul></p>
        <p><term>Part B: ``WOFHumanPlayer``</term>
            Next, we're going to define a class named <c>WOFHumanPlayer</c>, which should inherit from <c>WOFPlayer</c> (part A). This class is going to represent a human player. In addition to having all of the instance variables and methods that <c>WOFPlayer</c> has, <c>WOFHumanPlayer</c> should have an additional method:</p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>
                <p><c>.getMove(category, obscuredPhrase, guessed)</c>: Should ask the user to enter a move and return <term>whatever they entered</term> no matter what they enter.</p>
            </li>
        </ul></p>
        <p><c>.getMove()</c>'s prompt should be:</p>
        <pre>{name} has ${prizeMoney}

Category: {category}
Phrase:  {obscured_phrase}
Guessed: {guessed}

Guess a letter, phrase, or type 'exit' or 'pass':</pre>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <pre>Steve has $200

Category: Places
Phrase: _L___ER N____N_L P_RK
Guessed: B, E, K, L, N, P, R, X, Z

Guess a letter, phrase, or type 'exit' or 'pass':</pre>
        <p>The user can then enter:
            * <c>'exit'</c> to exit the game
            * <c>'pass'</c> to skip their turn
            * a single character to guess that character
            * a complete phrase &#8211; anything other than <c>'exit'</c> or <c>'pass'</c> &#8211; to guess that phrase</p>
        <p>Note that <c>.getMove()</c> <term>does not</term> need to enforce anything about the user's input; that will be done via the game logic.</p>
        <p><term>Part C: ``WOFComputerPlayer``</term>
            Next, we're going to define a class named <c>WOFComputerPlayer</c>, which should inherit from <c>WOFPlayer</c> (part A). This class is going to represent a computer player.</p>
        <p>Every computer player will have a <c>difficulty</c>, where players with a higher <c>difficulty</c> generally play <q>better</q>. There are many ways to implement this. We'll do the following:</p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>
                <dl>
                    <li>
                        <title>Semi-randomly decide whether to make a <q>good</q> move or a <q>bad</q> move on a given turn (a higher difficulty should make it more likely for the player to make a <q>good</q> move)</title>
                        
                            <p><ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>If we decide to make a <q>bad</q> move, we'll randomly decide on a possible letter</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>If we decide to make a <q>good</q> move, we'll choose a letter according to their overall frequency in the English language</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul></p>
                        
                    </li>
                </dl>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If there aren't any possible letters to choose (for example: if the last character is a vowel but this player doesn't have enough to guess a vowel), we'll <c>'pass'</c></p>
            </li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>We'll implement this in the <c>WOFComputerPlayer</c> class. In addition to having all of the instance variables and methods that <c>WOFPlayer</c> has, <c>WOFComputerPlayer</c> should have:</p>
        <p><term>Class variable</term></p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>
                <p><c>.SORTED_FREQUENCIES</c>: Should be set to <c>'ZQXJKVBPYGFWMUCLDRHSNIOATE'</c>, which is a list of English characters sorted from least frequent (<c>'Z'</c>) to most frequent (<c>'E'</c>). We'll use this when trying to make a <q>good</q> move.</p>
            </li>
        </ul></p>
        <p><term>Instance variables</term></p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>
                <p><c>.difficulty</c>: The level of difficulty for this computer (should be passed as the second argument into the constructor after <c>.name</c>)</p>
            </li>
        </ul></p>
        <p><term>Methods</term></p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>
                <p><c>.smartCoinFlip()</c>: This method will help us decide semi-randomly whether to make a <q>good</q> or <q>bad</q> move (again, a higher difficulty should make us more likely to make a <q>good</q> move). You should implement this by choosing a random number between <c>1</c> and <c>10</c> using <c>random.randint</c> (see above) and returning <c>True</c> if that random number is greater than <c>self.difficulty</c>. If the random number is equal to or less than <c>self.difficulty</c> then you should return <c>False</c>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <dl>
                    <li>
                        <title><c>.getPossibleLetters(guessed)</c>: This method should return a list of letters that can be guessed.</title>
                        
                            <p><ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>These should be characters that are in <c>LETTERS</c> (<c>'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'</c>) but <term>not</term> in the <c>guessed</c> parameter.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Additionally, if this player doesn't have enough prize money to guess a vowel (<c>VOWEL_COST</c>), then vowels (<c>VOWELS</c>: <c>'AEIOU'</c>) should <term>not</term> be included</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul></p>
